<TITLE>Installing and using qprof</title>
<BODY>
<H1>Installing qprof</h1>
To install qprof, unpack the distribution and change to the resulting
qprof-<version> directory.  Then:
<OL>
<LI>(Optional)
Make sure that the PREFIX variable in Makefile is set to the
appropriate installation directory.  Files will be installed in
$(PREFIX)/lib/qprof-<I>version</i>, $(PREFIX)/include/qprof-<I>version</i>,
and $(PREFIX)/doc/qprof-<I>version</i>.  The above directories will
be linked to
$(PREFIX)/lib/qprof, $(PREFIX)/include/qprof, and $(PREFIX)/doc/qprof.

<LI>(Optional)
Unpack a copy of <A HREF="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/libunwind/">
libunwind</a> in the source directory, or create a
symbolic link from libunwind-<version> to the identically named
source directory elsewhere.  (You will need at least version 0.93.
For version 0.93 on x86, apply the included libunwind-0.93.patch.)
If this step is performed, a very
basic version of call-stack profiling will become available.

<LI>(Optional)
Type "make" (or "make check" to also run tests).

<LI>(Needs permission to write to PREFIX directory, if set.)
Type "make install".
</ol>

<H1>To start profiling all programs run from a particular shell:</h1>
<OL>
<LI>Run "source <I>&lt;PREFIX from above&gt;</i>/lib/qprof/alias.csh" or
".  <I>&lt;PREFIX from above&gt;</i>/lib/qprof/alias.sh",
depending on your shell.
If you skipped step one above, PREFIX is
<I>&lt;build directory from above&gt;</i>/installed.
Or you can run the identical
scripts from the build directory.  For regular use, put one of the
above commands into your <TT>.bashrc</tt> or <TT>.cshrc</tt> files.
<LI>(Optional)In an ANSI color-capable terminal window (<I>e.g.</i> most
<TT>xterm</tt> variants), set the environment variable QPROF_COLOR to,
for example, "green" to distinguish profiling output from normal command
output.
<LI>Run <TT>qprof_start</tt> to start profiling.
<LI>Run commands to be profiled. 
<LI>Run <TT>qprof_stop</tt> to stop profiling.
</ol>

<H2>Assumptions made by the above:</h2>

<OL>
<LI> The LD_PRELOAD environment variable is not already
set for other reasons.  (If you don't know what it's used for, you're
probably OK.  If you do know what this means, you can probably fix up the
qprof_start and qprof_stop aliases to make things work with another preload
library.)

<LI> You are running only dynamically linked executables.  If you don't
know what this means, you can ignore it.  (Statically
linked programs can be profiled by calling the prof_utils.h routines
directly from the application to be profiled.)

<LI>There are no doubt some library version dependencies.  RedHat 7, 8, and 9
should work, as should other Linux distributions from the same era.

<LI>Nothing done by the process interferes with profiling.  Empirically,
this works fine for nearly all applications.  But since the profiler
runs as part of the application process, obscure kinds of interference
are probably possible.
</ol>

<H2>Interpreting the results:</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Each line in the output reflects a range of program addresses
(by default a line), and lists the number of times a program counter
in that range was sampled.  Lines containing large count values consumed
more processor time.
<LI>The output is usually far less informative if the program did not
contain debug information.  You can still get fully precise output from
such programs by setting the environment variable <TT>QPROF_GRANULARITY</tt>
to <TT>instruction</tt> (see below).
But it may be difficult to make sense out of the
hexadecimal addresses which will be printed as a result.
<LI>If you prefer to see "hot" regions of the program first, save the
output and pipe it through <TT>sort -n -k2 -r</tt>.  By default, profiling
output is written to stderr.  But see QPROF_FILE
<A HREF="environment_variables.txt">here</a>.
<LI>For multithreaded processes, each thread is sampled separately, and
the reported results are the sum of all samples.  Thus a process with
4 always runnable threads running on a 4 processor machine with the
default sampling frequency of 100 samples a second would report 400 samples
per second.
</ul>

<H2>Adjusting profiling output:</h2>

The output produced by qprof depends on several environment variables.
In particular, <TT>QPROF_GRANULARITY</tt> can be set to one of
<TT>function</tt>, <TT>line</tt>, or <TT>instruction</tt> to control
whether samples should summed for each function, line, or instruction.
Setting <TT>QPROF_REAL</tt> will cause the profiler to sample based on
wall clock time, and should thus point out where processes are waiting.
If libunwind was available during installation, setting
<TT>QPROF_STACK</tt> will effectively include time spent in called
functions to be included in the caller's (parent's) counts.
Other relevant environment variables are described
<A HREF="environment_variables.txt">here</a>.

<H1>To profile using hardware event counters:</h1>
(This currently works only on Itanium.)

<OL>
<LI>Install a supported underlying event counter library.  (Currently this is
Itanium <A HREF="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/perfmon/">perfmon</a>).
<LI>Add -DHW_EVENT_SUPPORT to CFLAGS in Makefile; Build as above.
(Perfmon must be installed for the profiler to build.  If it is missing
at runtime, qprof will still run, but without hardware event support.
If you are using libpfm3 on a 2.6 kernel, replace prof_utils.c in the
distribution with prof_utils.c.libpfm3.)
<LI>Run <TT>pfmon -l</tt> to find the appropriate event name.
<LI>Set the environment variable <TT>QPROF_HW_EVENT</tt> to the event
name.  Profile as above.  (<TT>QPROF_INTERVAL</tt> can be set to a
number <I>n</i> to indicate that the program counter should be sampled
every <I>n</i>th event.  By default <I>n</i> is 10,000.)
<LI>Note that the program counter is sampled when the process is notified of
the event.  This may be a few cycles after the event occurred.  For example,
cache miss events are likely to be attributed to an instruction that uses
the resulting value, or even a slightly later instruction.  You should be able
to determine which loop is causing cache misses, but it will take a little
bit of guess work to identify the actual load or store instruction.
