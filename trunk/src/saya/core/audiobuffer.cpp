// Programmer notes:

// In this implementation, the tail grows with each new write, while the head shrinks with each new read.
// To make this class thread-safe, we must ABSOLUTELY make sure that the writer does not write to m_Head,
// and that the reader does not write to m_Tail.

// Writing to the buffer will increase m_Tail, while reading from the buffer will increase m_Head
// (think of it as a snake moving backwards).

// Clearing will first set the m_Clear flag to true, and then set the tail equal to the head.
// if(m_Clear) is true, setting the m_Clear to false will be the last operation done by the writer.
// This is to avoid race conditions where the buffer is cleared by the writer but then the head is disminished by
// the reader, resulting in a garbage buffer of size m_Size.

        //
        // We divide the current frequency by the input frequency.
        // If our sample freq. is 22050 Hz and the input freq. is 44100 Hz, we have a 0.5 coefficient;
        // So for every input sample (at 44100 samples/sec), we have 0.5 output samples (at 22050 samples/sec).
        // What we do is accumulate this coefficient with time (actually just the remainder), and when the
        // sum is greater than one, we add it to the quotient.
        // This quotient gives us the actual number of samples that we must copy into our destination buffer.
        // For a coefficient of 0.5, every 2 input samples we get a quotient of 1, so that's what we actually
        // put in the buffer.

        // Let's do the opposite case. If our sample frequency is 44100 and the input frequency is 22050,
        // Our quotient is 2. It means that we must copy the sample received 2 times.

        // Now, for a mixed integer / fractional result. If our sample frequency is 48000 and the input
        // frequency is 44100, we get a coefficient of 1.08843... which means a quotient of 1 and a
        // remainder of 3900.
        // So everytime we add 1 copy of the input sample to the buffer, and add 3900 to the counter.
        // After the 12th time we're given a sample, we've added 3900 times 12 to the counter, which
        // makes it equal to 46800. That is greater than 44100 (the input sample frequency), meaning that
        // the remainder has reached an overflow. So we add 1 to the quotient and get the modulus.
        // This makes the quotient = 1 (the original quotient) + 1 (the overflow) = 2,
        // and the remainder counter is left at 2700 for the next input.
        // Since the quotient is 2, we copy the input sample twice.

        // The next overflow will come the 11th time, when the counter = 2700 + 3900*11 = 45600 = 44100 + 1500.
        // So we copy the sample twice and leave the counter at 1500.
        // And so on.

        // A final example: Input frequency = 32000 Hz. Our frequency = 48000.
        // coefficient = 48000 / 32000 = 1.5. Quotient = 1, remainder = 16000.
        // The second time we'll have an overflow at 16000 + 16000 = 32000, leaving the counter at 0.

        // Note that our sampling is rudimentary and we don't do anything to avoid aliasing artifacts.
