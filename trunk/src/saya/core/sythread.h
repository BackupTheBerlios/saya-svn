 * Comments:  The syThread and related classes are a
 *            reimplementation and clean-up of the wxWidgets
 *            wxThread API into one header and one cpp file
 *            (unlike wxWidgets, which has a .cpp and .h file
 *            per operating system).
 *            The majority of functions were the
 *            same, while others were rewritten from scratch.
 *            So if there's a bug, don't blame the wxThread
 *            authors, blame me (Rick) instead.
