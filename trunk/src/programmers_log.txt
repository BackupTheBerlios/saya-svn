Things I've learned by testing the Adobe Premiere UI:

* Some options in the clip menu apply to original clips (let's call them clip files)
* Some options apply only to clips as they're in the timeline (let's call them clip instances)
* There are video clips, and audio clips
* Audio clips can be linked to a video clip
* There needs to be an array for (pointers to?) video clips, and another for audio clips so we can have
  clip time synchronization without resorting to pointers. Those circular references are a pain in the arse.
* There are some menu options that only apply to "offline file" types of clips (placeholders),
  like capture options.
* The entries in the label menu can be changed in the setup, so these have to be generated at
  runtime
* A clip instance can be enabled or disabled, this alters the "enable" menu item in the clip menu.
* Same goes with "link / unlink" clip - which unlike in Premiere, we have separated in the menu
  to avoid programming complications.
* clips can be mono or stereo, and they can be separated

* Automate to sequence joins selected clips (storyboard) into a sequence. The sequence is appended
  to the current sequence in the timeline.
* import batch list prepares offline clips and sets their properties for batch recording.

* For the timeline, there needs to be two classes: One, a "readonly" timeline for modifying effects
  (and transitions?) unless we do the modifications in-place.... and a "readwrite" timeline.

  Perhaps the readonly timeline will have a pointer to the real timeline so clip timelines can be rendered
  by the real tracks.

* There needs to be a function in the frame called "updatemenu" that updates all the menu items. I remember
  that there was something similar in the codeblocks IDE.

* A clip instance needs at least the following properties:
  - its own #id.
  - audio clip #id, if in sync.
  - time difference with the video, if it's audio, for resync.
  - the clip instance's name
  - an array for the effects stack
  - a beginning transition pointer to a transition object (we need an array for transitions).
  - an ending transition pointer.
  - width, height
  - aspect ratio
  - the clip's starting video frame
  - the clip's starting time (for audio - perhaps we should use samples?)
  - the clip's length, in frames
  - the clip's modified duration (recalculated after processing speed effects)
  - the clip's original frames per sec
  - the clip's frames (interlacing) info

  - a flag telling if we're using time or frames for indicating starting/ending
  - a label color id
  - a flag telling if we're showing keyframes in the clip
  -

* Transitions need the ending clip and the beginning clip, they also need the info on
  which version of the clips  we're transitioning (after which effects - Premiere doesn't include this
  and therefore some transitions are messed up).

* Perhaps we also need "metaclips". Can a sequence be treated as a clip?
  That'd be cool, it'd simplify the work a lot.

* Testing kdesvn. I'm going to do a commit to make sure it works.
