* After browsing the web, i got some fears of infringing into trade secrets by having tested
  the Adobe UI. But after purchasing a couple of books and downloading a couple of tutorials
  from CreativeCow, my fears vanished. The little things I learned (the menu structures and basic
  usage) are common knowledge by now, and couldn't be qualified as Trade Secret. A good thing
  is that all use cases and data structures can be deduced from the books (they have screenshots -
  specially the one I purchased for less than 30 bucks)  and from the Creative Cow videos.

  The data structures mentioned in previous version of this file apply to software like Cinelerra,
  so they're not exclusive of Premiere. This is important since my product isn't in direct competition with
  Premiere, but with Cinelerra (which was the reason I started this project in the first place).

  But just to be on the safe side, I've deleted Premiere from my Harddrive and gave away the CD's
  and official docs - so no one can come out and tell me I've done reverse engineering
  or something. All the concepts regarding data structures that I had written here based on my
  own experiences with Premiere, have now been wiped, so I'll have to start from scratch using the
  Book.

  Having said this, I'll begin to work on the clips data structure after I finishing incorporating
  the undo/Redo implementation into the app's menus.
