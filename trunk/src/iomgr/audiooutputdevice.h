/** @brief Generic class for Audio Output
  *
  * The AudioOutputDevice class is a generic output class that will connect an audio output device driver (or file encoder)
  * with a data source. This class is only a wrapper;
  * It can be an MP3 decoder, a sound generator, or in our case, the audio output for our project.
  * The A/Vsyncrhonization and optional frame skipping needs to be handled by a streaming class.
  * This class has the following virtual methods (not including the destructor) that must be implemented by derived classes:
  *
  * InitializeOutput()          - Initializes the output device.
  * Clear()                     - Mutes the audio output device.
  * DisconnectOutput()          - Disconnects the output device from the program.
  * LoadAudioData()             - Loads audio data for a single channel
  * RenderData()                - Sends the multichannel data stream from the buffer to the output device.
  * SetDeviceSampleFreq()       - Tries to Set the output device's sample frequency.
  * SetDeviceBytesPerSample()   - Tries to set the output device's bytes-per-sample size.
  * GetDeviceNumChannels()      - Gets the output device's number of channels.
  *
  * All of these methods are protected. Additionally, there's a non-virtual, protected method:
  *
  * GetChannelBuffer()          - Gets the output buffer for a given audio channel.
  *
  * These protected methods are used by the derived classes to implement low-level audio playback / encoding.
