HIGH PRIORITY TASKS (TODO LIST)
===============================

Rick
====

* Switch time units to avtime_t. DEFERRED FOR LATER.
  The core (iomgr/ ) and in the vidproject/ classes need their time units to be converted to avtime_t.
  This way, making the transition from milliseconds to nanoseconds for time measurement will be much easier.

* Complete the minimum features for the AVDevices.
  Verify that VideoInputDevice, AudioInputDevice, VideoOutputDevice and AudioOutputDevice have the
  necessary functions to work.

* Implement the AVController class for A/V playback.
  The AVController class is needed to implement the video player. It should be much easier to write now
  that we're going to use different threads for audio-in, audio-out, video-in and video-out.

Rigo
====

* Implement the thread unit tests.
  Without them, we won't be able to efficiently debug the threads module.

* Implement the visual controls for the Video Player.

Javier Galicia
==============

* Implement the basic wxWidgets controls for the Timeline.


TASKS DONE
==========

* Finish rewriting VideoOutputDevice::LoadVideoData (done 2008-10-22)
  VideoOutputDevice::LoadVideoData in videooutputdevice.cpp is being rewritten because we need
  a way to switch the input/output/temp bitmap addresses (lock-free if possible) so that reading the
  data from the source does not cause any delays with writing the data into the destination.
