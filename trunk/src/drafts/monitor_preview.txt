HOW to implement the monitor preview:

The common class VideoOutputDevice contains everything (I hope) we need to implement video playback (per frame -
we'll deal with the timing details later).

What we need to do, is create some classes which derivate from VideoOutputDevice.

1) We can start with a NullVideoOutputDevice class, that simply does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

2) Based on this class, we can start tying it up to the wxWidgets Monitor / Preview panel.

3) When everything's done, we can make a "debug test" to display an image on the display. Of course, it will show nothing.

4) Now let's make a standard bitmap drawer with wxWidgets. The wxWidgets part will be hidden from the interface
   (that's how it should be) and make it the default.

5) The hardest part will be integrating SDL onto this thing.

6) When we can display images through SDL, we're ready for the next step: Integrating video playback (to be continued).

UPDATE (22/Jul/2008) :

I finally found out how to make the VideoOutputDevice classes simple to implement. Use wxWidgets-specific implementations of them,
and use the VideoOutputDevice interface to communicate with the rest of the program. This doesn't break the framework design, and
at the same time allows us to use existing wxWidgets implementations of SDL.
